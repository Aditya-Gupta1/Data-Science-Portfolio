# Hand-Written Image Classification using Supervised Learning Algorithms
This project uses the famous MNIST dataset for Multi-Class Classification. This dataset is in-built in scikit-learn's library and can be loaded easily. It contains a set of images which are basically images of handwritten digits along with their respective labels.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to practise multi-class Classification using supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN and Support Vector Machines(SVC).

## Steps Involved
1. Load the dataset from scikit-learn
2. Initialize models by calling their respective constructors
3. Making predictions on the test data
4. Producing Classification Report along with Confusion Matrix of the models

## Summary
1. Logistic Regression F1-Score : 0.96
2. KNN f1-Score : 0.99
3. SVM f1-Score : 0.99
